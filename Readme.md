A dark theme for GNUstep. This theme is freely redistribuable under the terms of the GPLv3 License.

Author Bertrand Dekoninck 2019, modifications for Manjaro and integration of DBus menu by Johannes Brakensiek 2021.

This branch needs a working installation of DBusKit (dependency).

Set

- NSMenuInterfaceStyle to NSMacintoshInterfaceStyle for using the global horizontal menu drawn by GNUstep.
- NSMenuInterfaceStyle to NSWindows95InterfaceStyle for using a global menu via DBus (your DE needs to provide a corresponding widget).

A dark theme for windowmaker (Sombre.themed) is also provided.
